# Vaporware 

Vaporware is a CMO research pipeline processing WES & WGS tumor-normal pairs using the [Nextflow framework](https://www.nextflow.io/). Currently the pipeline is composed of alignment and QC, and detection of both somatic alterations and germline variants. Users can begin with inputs of either paired-end FASTQs or BAMs, and process these via the command line.
