# Tempo 

Tempo is a CMO Computational Sciences (CCS) research pipeline processing WES & WGS tumor-normal pairs using the [Nextflow framework](https://www.nextflow.io/). Currently the pipeline is composed of alignment and QC, and detection of both somatic alterations and germline variants. Users can begin with inputs of either paired-end FASTQs or BAMs, and process these via the command line. 

For further details of how to begin processing data with Tempo, please view our [documentation](https://ccstempo.netlify.com/). For contributing to this project, please make a pull request as detailed [here](https://ccstempo.netlify.com/contributing-to-tempo.html).
