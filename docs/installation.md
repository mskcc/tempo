# Installation

## Installing Nextflow

Install Nextflow in the current directory by running:
```shell
curl -s https://get.nextflow.io | bash
```
Put the `nextflow` executable in a directory in your `PATH`, if you want to access it from anywhere. For more details, check out the [documentation](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/getstarted.html).

Nextflow version 19.10.0 or later is required.

You're now good to go!
