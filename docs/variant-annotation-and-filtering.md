## Somatic SNVs and Indels

Variant-level annotation, filtering, and flagging of variants with further filter flags occur in the `SomaticCombineChannel` and `SomaticAnnotateMaf` processes. The union of variants that pass the somatic scoring models intrinsic to the callers (`FILTER="PASS"` in the VCF files) are combined, giving precedence to MuTect2 for any site where both callers detected a variant. 

The functional effect of variants is predicted using [VEP](https://www.ensembl.org/vep) using [vcf2maf](https://github.com/mskcc/vcf2maf), which also converts from VCF into a tab-delimited MAF file. See notes on use of [preferred transcript isoforms](reference-resources.md#preferred-transcript-isoforms) and [VEP annotation outputs](https://useast.ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/vep/vep_formats.html#output).

The following columns are added to the final MAF file, in addition to those added during the VEP annotation:
- `Strelka2FILTER`: Indicates that Strelka2 detected the variant but did not classify it as a somatic variant.
- `gnomAD_FILTER`: Indicates that the variant was detected in the gnomAD workflow, but ultimately _not_ classified as a _germline_ variant. Note that this is not used in current filtering schema.
- `RepeatMasker` and `EncodeDacMapability`: The variant locus is in a repeat, low-mappability, or hard-to-sequence region. More details in the [reference file description](reference-resources.md#repeatmasker-and-mappability-blacklist).
- `PoN`: Panel-of-normals, the number of normal samples in which the variant was detected. [More details on the implementation for exomes](wes-panel-of-normals.md). Under development for genomes, currently applies exome PoN. 
- `Ref_Tri`: Trinucleotide context of SNVs, normalized to pyrimidine-to-purine transversions.
- gnomAD allele frequencies, [more details here](gnomad.md):
    - Exomes, columns named `non_cancer_*`: Allele counts (`AC`) and frequencies (`AF`) for the variant in the non-TCGA population and sub-populations of gnomAD.
    - Genomes, columns named (`AC_*`|`AF_*`): Allele counts and frequencies for the variant in populations and sub-populations of gnomAD.
- Raw allele counts: total and strand specific (`*_fwd` and `*_rev`) allele `count` and `depth` for tumor (`t_*`) and normal (`n_*`). These are unfiltered values, in contrast to those from the variant callers, generated by [GetBaseCountsMultiSample](https://github.com/zengzheng123/GetBaseCountsMultiSample).
- `alt_bias`: For variants with a _raw_ depth of at least 5 reads, this is true if all _raw_ variant-supporting reads are on either the forward or reverse strand.
- `ref_bias`: For variants with a _raw_ depth of at least 5 reads, this is true if all _raw_ reads are on either the forward or reverse strand.
- Mutation hotspots, also see :
    - `snv_hotspot`: SNV hotspots.
    - `threeD_hotspot`: 3D hotspots, in contrast to abovementioned "linear" hotspots.
    - `indel_hotspot` and `indel_hotspot_type`: In-frame indel indel hotspots, and indication of whether it overlaps a prior indel hotspot locus (`prior`) or overlaps an SNV hotspot (`novel`).
    - `Hotspot`: `TRUE` if either a linear SNV or indel hotspot.
- OncoKB annotation:
    - `mutation_effect` and `oncogenic`: Indicate the functional effect of the mutation and whether it is deemed to be oncogenic
    - `LEVEL_*` and `Highest_level`: Indicates whether there is any drug at the given level of actionability and which is the highest level of actionability, if any. Note that this is cancer-type agnostic in current implementation.
    - `citations`: References for OncoKB annotation.
- Variant caller metadata (development feature, subject to changes):
    - MuTect2<sup>1</sup>:
        - `MBQ`: Median base quality, comma-separated for reference and alternate allele.
        - `MFRL`: Median fragment length, comma-separated for reference and alternate allele.
        - `MMQ`: Median mapping quality, comma-separated for reference and alternate allele.
        - `MPOS`: Median distance of variant from end of read.
        - `OCM`: Number of reads whose original alignment does not match the reference.
        - `RPA`: If tandem repeat, number of times repeated (can be comma-separated for reference and alternate allele).
        - `STR`: Boolean, indicating that variant is a short tandem repeat.
        - `ECNT`: Number of events in haplotype.
    - Strelka2<sup>2</sup>:
        - `MQ`: Root mean square mapping quality.
        - `SNVSB`: Strand bias for somatic SNVs.
        - `FDP`: Number of basecalls filtered from original read depth for tier 1* read counts, for tumor (`t_FDP`) and normal (`n_FDP`).
        - `SUBDP`: Number of reads below tier 1 mapping-quality threshold aligned across site, for tumor (`t_SUBDP`) and normal (`n_SUBDP`).
        - `RU`: If indel, smallest repeating sequence unit in inserted or deleted sequence.
        - `IC`: If indel, number of times `RU` is repeated in variant.

The `FILTER` column in the unfiltered MAF file, can contain any semi colon-separated combination of the following filter flags, or say `PASS`:
- `part_of_mnv`: The variant is likely part of another called multi-nucleotide variant (MNV).
- `multiallelic2`: Multiallelic loci, likely artifact. For variants called by Strelka2. The `2` is added due the presence of `multiallelic` flag in the MuTect2 VCFs.
- `strand_bias`, variants likely artifactual due to strand bias:
    - For variants called by Mutect2, if all supporting reads come from one strand and there are a least 10 reads on both strands in either normal or tumor sample.
    - For variants called by Strelka2, if the total alternate read count is above 10 and all of these fall on either strand; or low mapping-quality variant suffering from bias in both supporting reads and total reads.
- `caller_conflict`: Variant was detected by both callers, but did not pass Strelka2's thresholds for somatic variant calling.
- The following read depth-based flags are parameterized according to the sequencing platform, see the `exome.config` and `genome.config` files.
    - `low_vaf`: Variant falls below lower threshold for tumor variant allele fraction (VAF).
    - `low_t_depth`: Variant falls below lower threshold for total depth in the tumor.
    - `low_t_alt_count`: Variant falls below lower threshold for reads supporting variant allele in tumor.
    - `low_n_depth`: Variant falls below lower threshold for total depth in normal.
    - `high_n_alt_count`: Variant exceeds upper threshold for reads supporting variant allele normal.
    - `mappability`/`repeatmasker`: Variant falls in blacklisted genomic region.
    - `high_gnomad_pop_af`: Variant exceeds upper threshold for allele fraction in gnomAD.
    - `PoN`: Variant exceeds upper threshold for count in panel of normals.
    - `low_mapping_quality`: For indels called by Strelka2, variant falls below lower mapping quality threshold.

### Whitelisting
Mutational hotspots, where the value in `Hotspot` is `TRUE`, are retained in the filtered MAF file, if they:
- Are flagged with `low_vaf` but the tumor VAF is at least 0.02.
- Are flagged with `low_mapping_quality`, `low_t_depth`, or `strand_bias`.

_Note: Combinations of above filter flags results in filtering of the variant._

### Clonality and Zygosity Analyses

#### Clonality

Clonality of SNVs and indels is estimated based on [prior literature](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22544022) using [facets-suite](https://github.com/mskcc/facets-suite). The cancer-cell fraction (CCF) annotation (columns `ccf_*`) contains these estimates for three presumed copy-number configurations of the mutation:
1. Inferred CCF if mutation exists in number of copies expected from observed VAF and local ploidy.
2. Inferred CCF if mutation is on the major allele.
3. Inferred CCF if mutation exists in one copy.
For each of these, error intervals and probabilities are provided.

#### Zygosity

Tumor zygosity of SNVs and indels is estimated using the observed VAF and the expected VAF at the observed tumor purity and local copy number.

## Germline SNVs and Indels

Variant-level annotation, filtering, and flagging of variants with further filter flags occur in the `GermlineCombineChannel` and `GermlineAnnotateMaf` processes. The union of variants that pass the filters intrinsic to the callers (`FILTER="PASS"` in the VCF files) are combined, giving precedence to HaplotypeCaller for any site where both callers detected a variant. See discussion elsewhere regarding [single-sample filtering of HaplotypeCaller variant calls](https://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/gatk/discussion/23216/how-to-filter-variants-either-with-vqsr-or-by-hard-filtering).

Functional effect predication and MAF file conversion is carried out as described above for somatic calls.

In the final MAF, columns `Strelka2FILTER`, `gnomAD_FILTER`, `RepeatMasker` and `EncodeDacMapability` as well as allele frequencies and counts from gnomAD are identical as described for somatic variants. Note that the `gnomAF_FILTER` is used for filterig of germline variants, unlike for somatic variants.
In addition, the following columns are added to the germline MAF:
- [BRCA exchange](https://www.brcaexchange.org) annotation:
    - `brca_exchange_id`: Variant ID.
    - `brca_exchange_enigma`: Annotation from the ENIGMA consortium.
    - `brca_exchange_clinvar`: Annotation from ClinVar.
- `ch_gene`: Boolean indicating whether the gene is associated with the presence of clonal hematopoiesis (CH) (<small>_ASXL1_, _ATM_, _BCOR_, _CALR_, _CBL_, _CEBPA_, _CREBBP_, _DNMT3A_, _ETV6_, _EZH2_, _FLT3_, _GNAS_, _IDH1_, _IDH2_, _JAK2_, _KIT_, _KRAS_, _MPL_, _MYD88_, _NF1_, _NPM1_, _NRAS_, _PPM1D_, _RAD21_, _RUNX1_, _SETD2_, _SF3B1_, _SH2B3_, _SRSF2_, _STAG2_, _STAT3_, _TET2_, _TP53_, _U2AF1_, _WT1_, and _ZRSR2_)</small>
- The following read depth-based flags are parameterized according to the sequencing platform, see the `exome.config` and `genome.config` files.
    - `low_n_depth`: Variant falls below lower threshold for total depth in normal.
    - `low_n_vaf`: Variant falls below lower threshold for normal VAF.
    - `ch_mutation`: Variant occurs in CH gene and occurs below lower threshold for normal VAF and below tumor VAF 0.25.
    - `t_in_n_contamination`: Tumor VAF is more than three-fold the normal VAF. 



### Zygosity Analysis

Similar to somatic mutations, tumor zygosity of germline SNVs and indels is estimated using the observed VAF and the expected VAF at the observed tumor purity and local copy number. The difference between the two cases is the calculation of the expected tumor VAF of the variant.
